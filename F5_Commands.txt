#####If You're Using the Web GUI:
Log in to your F5 BIG-IP Web UI.

In the left-hand menu, go to: Local Traffic > Virtual Servers > Virtual Server List.

At the top-right of the list, there’s a search/filter box.

Enter this in the filter box:

Copy code
EPA*
or just:

nginx
Copy code
EPA
This will filter and show virtual servers whose names begin with "EPA".

The search is usually case-sensitive depending on version, so if “epa” doesn’t work, try “EPA”.


Search for a list of virtual servers with starting with the letter EPA 

tmsh:
tmsh list ltm virtual | grep -i 'ltm virtual EPA'

bash:
tmsh list ltm virtual | grep -i 'ltm virtual EPA' | awk '{print $3}'
